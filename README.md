## 4.Responsive Web Design
**This course has improved my knowledge of responsive web design.**
* **I studied several patterns of web pages and tried to implement them.**
* **There were a lot of subtleties that I did not understand before.**

## 5.JavaScript Basics
**Honestly, this course for me was extremely interesting and cognitive. I learned a lot of new things.When I started performing freecodecamp, I realized that my knowledge was far from ideal.I knew how to perform most tasks, I devised algorithms for them, but since I did not know the language ideally therefore most tasks were performed with hints.I am a little disappointed in myself. But this will not prevent me from progressing !!!**
